#  Americans Lose $246 Billion a Year in Gambling

Casinos and lotteries in the United States are a $246-billion industry, yet they largely go unregulated.

Gambling can have harmful effects on people’s lives and the economy. The National Gambling Impact Study Commission found that in 1998, Americans lost $40.4 billion to gambling (other studies have estimated the figure is now over $100 billion). Adults who gamble are two to three times more likely than non-gamblers to have mental health problems, including pathological and problem gambling, depression, and suicide.

States that allow casinos see increased crime rates—including burglary, robbery, and assault—in surrounding areas. A 2001 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that a 10% increase in casino size leads to a 1.4% increase in crime rates. By contrast, states without casinos have generally seen a decline in crime rates.

Gambling also harms children. According to the Harvard Medical School Division on Addiction, children of parents who are problem or pathological gamblers are four times more likely to become problem gamblers themselves. They are also at risk for developmental problems and various emotional and behavioral difficulties.

Gambling addiction costs Americans jobs, homes, and relationships. It also harms businesses as addicts lose money that could be used to purchase goods and services. In addition, businesses may be forced to close because of employees’ gambling addictions.

The government should regulate casinos and lotteries in order to protect consumers from the harmful effects of gambling. Casino operators should be required to provide information about the risks of gambling so that people can make informed decisions about whether or not to participate. Operators should also be prohibited from targeting vulnerable populations such as children and those with gambling addiction problems.

# But the casino industry is lobbying to overturn a new federal ban on online gambling. Trump Taj Mahal Closes after 26 Years, Citing Struggles with Gambling Revenue

The closure of the Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City after 26 years of operation is yet another sign of the struggles the American gambling industry is facing. The casino is shutting down because it can no longer compete with rivals in neighboring states that have more favorable gambling laws. But the casino industry is lobbying to overturn a new federal ban on online gambling, which they say could help revive their businesses.

Supporters of online gambling argue that it is a way to recapture some of the business that has been lost to state-sponsored lotteries and Indian casinos. They also say that it would create jobs and generate tax revenue. But opponents argue that online gambling can be addictive and pose a safety risk. They also worry that it could lead to financial instability for households that are overextended in their gambling debts.

The future of online gambling in the United States is still uncertain, but the closure of the Trump Taj Mahal shows that the industry faces significant challenges.

# The casino, once owned by Donald Trump, filed for bankruptcy in 2014 after years of financial troubles related to its gambling operation. Singapore Gambling Revenue Hits Record High in 2016

The casino, once owned by Donald Trump, filed for bankruptcy in 2014 after years of financial troubles related to its gambling operation. The company’s debt reached more than $1 billion, and it closed its doors to the public in October 2014.

However, the casino is making a comeback. In 2016, the Singapore gambling industry brought in a record $5.9 billion in revenue, with the Marina Bay Sands casino accounting for almost half of that amount.

The success of Marina Bay Sands is due in part to its extensive offerings. Not only does the casino have a large number of gaming tables and slot machines, but it also has luxury hotels, restaurants, and shops.

In addition to Marina Bay Sands, there are several other casinos in Singapore that are doing well. Resorts World Sentosa had total revenue of $1.7 billion in 2016, while Genting Highlands Resort brought in $1.3 billion.

Despite the success of the Singapore gambling industry, there are some concerns about its future. Some experts believe that the increasing popularity of online gambling will lead to a decline in revenue from brick-and-mortar casinos.

# The city-state's casinos pulled in $5.78 billion last year, up 17% from 2015. Macau Casino Industry Suffers Worst Quarter Since Financial Crisis

The casino industry in Macau, a city-state located on the southern coast of China, suffered its worst quarterly performance since the global financial crisis in 2009, according to Reuters.

Casino revenue in Macau totaled $5.78 billion last year, up 17% from 2015 but below market expectations, the news agency said Wednesday, citing data from the Macau Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau. Revenue growth has been slowing for several years as Chinese high-rollers, who have been key to the industry's success, have been spending less.

"The slowdown in China's economy has taken its toll on VIP gambling activity in Macau," David Dai, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd., told Reuters. "Mass market is still growing but not as fast as VIP."

In March alone, casino revenue totaled $1.51 billion, down 17% from a year earlier and far below the $2.25 billion forecast by analysts polled by Reuters. That was the steepest decline since September 2009.

# Gambling revenues in the Chinese enclave plummeted by nearly 40% in the third quarter of 2017. Why slot machines are so addictive: They're designed to give you just enough wins to keep you coming back for more

Gambling is outlawed in mainland China, but Macau is a special administrative region where it is legal. Despite this, gambling revenues in Macau have been on the decline since 2014. In the third quarter of 2017, they plummeted by nearly 40%.

There are a number of reasons for this downturn. The Chinese government has been cracking down on corruption, and many high-rollers have been scared off by increased scrutiny. The slowdown in the Chinese economy has also taken its toll.

But perhaps the biggest reason for the decline is that slot machines are just too addictive. They're designed to give you just enough wins to keep you coming back for more. As a result, many people find themselves losing money they can't afford to lose.

The good news is that there are signs that the gambling industry in Macau is starting to rebound. In the fourth quarter of 2017, gambling revenues increased by 5%. This suggests that people are starting to come back to the casinos, knowing that they can afford to lose a little bit of money and not worry about it ruining their lives.
