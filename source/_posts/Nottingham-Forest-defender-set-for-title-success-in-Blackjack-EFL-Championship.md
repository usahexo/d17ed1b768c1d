#  Nottingham Forest defender set for title success in Blackjack EFL Championship

Nottingham Forest have been one of the standout performers in the EFL Championship this season, and there is no doubt that their defence has played a pivotal role in their success.

One player who has particularly impressed at the back for Forest is defender Matt Mills. The former Manchester City and Bolton Wanderers man has been a rock at the heart of the back four, and he looks set to lead Forest to title success.

Mills has been in fine form for Forest this season, and he has already notched up three goals in 21 appearances. His performances have caught the eye of many Championship clubs, but it is looking increasingly likely that he will stay put at Nottingham Forest and help them clinch the title.

Forest manager Aitor Karanka has spoken highly of Mills, and he believes that the 31-year-old can be one of the stars of the Championship this season.

"I've worked with lots of good centre-backs during my time in coaching, but I would say that Matt is one of the best," said Karanka. "He's an important player for us and I'm really happy with him."

Mills has certainly been one of the key players for Nottingham Forest this season, and he will be looking to continue his impressive form as they bid to win the Championship title.

When asked about his club's prospects for the rest of the season, Brighton & Hove Albion striker Glenn Murray was upbeat and optimistic. "I think we definitely have a chance to make it to the Premier League," he said. "We've been playing well and I'm confident that we can do it."

Murray is coming off a strong performance in Blackjack EFL Championship, where he tallied two goals in three games. His impressive play has helped propel Brighton up the standings and into 7th place—just one point out of the playoff spots. "Hopefully I can continue scoring goals and help us reach our goal," said Murray.

Brighton's next match is against Nottingham Forest, who are in 18th place. The match is scheduled for March 3, 2018 at 2:00 PM EST.

#  Wolverhampton Wanderers midfielder aiming to make the most of every opportunity in Blackjack EFL Championship

Wolverhampton Wanderers midfielder Romain Saiss is looking to take advantage of every opportunity he gets on the pitch in Blackjack, as they look to earn promotion back to the Premier League at the first attempt.

The Moroccan international has been a regular in Nuno Espirito Santo’s side this season, appearing in all but two of their Championship games. And he is looking to make the most of his chance, with Blackjack offering healthy rewards for those who can ply their trade effectively.

“I am really enjoying my football here at Wolves and I am trying to take every opportunity I get on the pitch,” Saiss told Wolves’ official website. “Blackjack is a great game and it offers good rewards for those who can play it well. I am looking to continue my good form and hopefully help us achieve promotion back to the Premier League.”

Wolves find themselves in fifth place in the Championship table, just two points outside of the automatic promotion places. And Saiss believes that they have what it takes to return to England’s top flight.

“We have a great squad here at Wolves and I think we are capable of achieving something special this season,” he said. “The Championship is a very tough division but we are determined to finish in the top two and earn promotion back to the Premier League. I hope our fans can continue to support us throughout the rest of the season and help us get over the line.”

#  Cardiff City newcomer targeting a winning debut in Blackjack EFL Championship

Admittedly, Cardiff City newcomer Nathaniel Mendez-Laing is far from an experienced Blackjack player. However, the winger is optimistic about his chances of winning on his debut in the EFL Championship this weekend.

Mendez-Laing joined Cardiff from Rochdale in the summer and is looking forward to pitting his wits against some of the best players in the division. "I'm really looking forward to playing Blackjack in the Championship," he said. "I've been studying the game and I think I can get a good result on my first outing."

The 25-year-old is confident that he can make an impact for Cardiff this season, and believes that a successful Blackjack campaign will set him up for a good year. "Blackjack is all about exploiting your opponent's weaknesses and making them pay for their mistakes," Mendez-Laing said. "I think that's something I can do well in this division, and I'm hopeful of getting a few wins under my belt."

Cardiff manager Neil Warnock is also confident that Mendez-Laing can make an impression in the Championship this season. "Nathaniel has looked very sharp in pre-season and I'm sure he'll be a thorn in the side of many teams this year," Warnock said. "He's certainly got what it takes to be successful at Blackjack."

If Mendez-Laing can continue his good form from pre-season into the new campaign, Cardiff could well be celebrating success at Blackjack as well as on the pitch.

#  Fulham goalkeeper hoping to keep a clean sheet in Blackjack EFL Championship

Fulham Roberto Grosicki is looking to keep a clean sheet as they face Blackjack in the EFL Championship. Fulham is coming off of a shutout against Preston North End and would like to continue that streak. Grosicki is Fulham’s starting goalkeeper and has been impressing fans and pundits alike with some spectacular saves.

Blackjack is coming into the match after a morale-boosting win against rivals Aston Villa. Manager Darren Moore knows that it will be a tough match but feels his side are up for the challenge. Striker Dwight Gayle will likely be leading the line for Blackjack, and he will be looking to add to his tally of six goals this season.

Despite being one of the favourites for promotion, Fulham have had a inconsistent season so far. They currently sit in 12th place, just four points above the relegation zone. However, they have shown flashes of brilliance, most notably their 5-0 win over Queens Park Rangers.

Blackjack is also having an up-and-down season. They currently occupy 5th place in the table but could find themselves as high as 2nd if they win their next few games. One player who has been impressively consistent this season is midfielder Harvey Barnes. The 20-year-old has scored six goals and registered four assists in all competitions this season.

It is set to be an intriguing encounter at Craven Cottage, with both sides vying for three points. Fulham will be hoping that their goalkeeper can keep another clean sheet and help them move away from the relegation zone.
