The Senegalese Minister of Youth and Sports, Matar Ba, has announced the launch of a new deck of playing cards, specifically designed for poker enthusiasts.

The new deck, which has been named "Le jeu du Président" (The President's Game), is made up of 52 cards, plus two jokers. The backs of the cards feature a colorful national flag design, while the fronts display images of influential Senegalese historical figures.

According to Minister Ba, the aim of the new deck is to promote Senegal's rich cultural heritage, as well as to increase interest in the popular card game amongst locals. He expressed hope that the Le jeu du Président will encourage more people to take up poker, and help boost tourism in Senegal.

Poker players in Senegal are already excited about the release of the new deck. Abdourahamane Diallo, a local player and spokesperson for the Poker Association of Senegal (APS), said that he was looking forward to trying it out. "I'm really happy about this news," he said. "The Senegalese deck will be a great addition to our poker arsenal."

Diallo added that he hoped the new deck would help promote poker in Africa as a whole. "Africa is a huge continent with a lot of potential in terms of poker growth," he said. "We're seeing increasing interest in the game here, and I think that trend will continue."

The launch of Le jeu du Président comes at an exciting time for poker in Africa. In recent years, the continent has seen an influx of international players, as well as the development of several major tournaments. Last year's edition of The Hendon Mob African Poker Cup drew over 200 participants from 17 countries, including Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya.

#  52 Card Poker Deck Released in Senegal!

In what can be seen as an interesting move to revive the centuries-old card game of poker in Senegal, a new 52-card deck has been released. The deck, produced by local entrepreneur Babacar Dia, is fashioned in the traditional Senegalese style with brightly coloured pictures and symbols.

Dia, who owns a printing company in Dakar, says that he came up with the idea for the new deck out of nostalgia for his childhood days playing poker with friends. "We would often play for money and it was always great fun," he recalls. "I thought it would be nice to revive the tradition and introduce the game to a new generation."

The new deck has quickly become popular among locals, who are enthusiastic about its vibrant colours and intricate designs. In addition to playing poker, many people are using the cards for traditional Senegalese games such as mensere and bourée.

Poker is believed to have originated in China several centuries ago. From there it spread to Europe and North America where it became extremely popular. However, in recent years its popularity has declined in many countries as electronic games such as online poker have gained favour.

In Senegal, however, poker remains a popular pastime and the release of the new deck is seen as a positive development for the game. "It's great to see that people are still interested in playing poker," says Dia. "I hope that my deck will help to revive interest in the game and encourage more people to give it a try."
