#  Mississippi Keno legalized! Who's ready to start betting?

On Tuesday, November 6th, Mississippi voters approved a ballot measure to legalize casino-style Keno games throughout the state. The vote was very close, but ultimately Keno won by a margin of 51% to 49%.

Who's ready to start betting?

Keno is a casino game that involves players guessing which numbers will be drawn out of a pool of 80. The player then bets on how many of those numbers they think will be chosen. Prizes are awarded for correctly guessing as few as four or as many as all ten numbers.

There are already nine casinos in Mississippi that offer Keno, and now that it's been legalized statewide, those casinos stand to make even more money. In fact, the industry is expected to generate $5 million in annual tax revenue for the state government. That's good news for everyone involved!

 Casinos aren't the only ones who stand to benefit from legalized Keno. Players can also look forward to earning some extra cash by playing the game. And with jackpots reaching into the six figures, there's plenty of incentive to give it a try.

So far, there hasn't been any word on when the first Keno games will be up and running in Mississippi, but we can expect that it won't be long now that the vote has been tallied. In the meantime, you can start practicing by playing online at one of the many sites that offer Keno games. Just make sure you're familiar with the rules before you start betting real money!

#  Finally, Mississippi residents can legally bet on sports!

After years of failed attempts, the Mississippi state legislature has finally passed a bill legalizing sports betting in the state. The new law, which was signed by Governor Phil Bryant on Monday, allows casinos and racetracks to offer sports betting services to their customers.

This is great news for Mississippi residents, who have been clamoring for the opportunity to bet on sports legally for years. Not only will this make sports betting more convenient, but it will also generate much-needed revenue for the state government.

Casinos and racetracks are already gearing up for the launch of sports betting services, and they are expected to be up and running by the start of the NFL season in September. In the meantime, residents can start placing their bets at offshore gambling sites like Bovada or Sportsbetting.ag.

There has been a lot of debate over whether or not sports betting should be legalized, but there is no doubt that it will be a lucrative industry in Mississippi. In fact, according to one study, legalization could generate as much as $24 million in annual tax revenue for the state government.

So far, only a handful of states have legalized sports betting, but that is likely to change in the coming years. With so much money on the line, it's only a matter of time before other states follow suit.

How Does Mississippi Keno Work?

Keno is a simple game to play. In each round, 20 numbers are drawn at random from a pool of 80 numbers.

The odds generally range from 1 in 8 for betting one number to 1 in 25 for betting 10 numbers. However, as with all lotteries, there is no guarantee of winning any prize â€“ even if you match all 10 of your chosen numbers!

What Are the Prizes?

The prizes available vary depending on the keno game being played, but they can be quite lucrative. Some games offer jackpots worth tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars! Smaller prizes are also available for matching fewer numbers. Be sure to check the prize payout schedule before playing so you know what you could win.
