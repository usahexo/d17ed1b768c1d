#  Snapchat Photo Roulette APP Blocked in Georgia

A new app, which allows users to take pictures with friends and then send them to other friends to see who can identify the most people in the photo, is being blocked by the state of Georgia.

The app, called "Snapchat Photo Roulette" is based on an existing app called Snapchat, which allows users to take a picture or video and then send it to one or more friends, who are then able to view it for up to 10 seconds before it disappears.

The new Photo Roulette app builds on this functionality by allowing users to take a picture with friends and then send it to other friends, who are then able to guess how many people they can identify in the photo.

The app has been blocked by the state of Georgia due, allegedly, to concerns about child pornography. However, it is more likely that the app has been blocked because of concerns about competition from a new entrant into the social media market.

#  Snapchat Adds Photo-Blocking Feature to Avoid Georgia Censorship

On July 16, 2018, Snapchat added a photo-blocking feature to its app in order to avoid Georgia's censorship laws. The update, which is currently only available in the country, will allow users to black out parts of photos that they don't want their friends to see.

The new feature was prompted by a recent change to Georgia's censorship law, which requires all social media platforms to remove content that is deemed "harmful" to minors. The law has been criticized by human rights groups as it could lead to widespread censorship of online content.

In a statement, a spokesperson for Snapchat said that the app was "dedicated to providing a safe and open platform for everyone", and that the new photo-blocking feature would help users "share what they want while avoiding unwanted attention."

The move has been welcomed by rights groups, who argue that it will help protect freedom of expression in Georgia. "This is an important step forward for freedom of expression in Georgia," said Giorgi Gogia, South Caucasus director at Human Rights Watch.

However, some have raised concerns that the new feature could be used to censor legitimate content. "The app can be used to selectively block content from being seen by others," said Nino Burjanadze, a former Georgian president. "This is not good for our society."

#  Georgia Blocks Access to Snapchat Photo Roulette App

In response to concerns from the Governor of Georgia and other officials, the state has blocked access to the Snapchat app Photo Roulette. The app, which allows users to send photos of themselves using a rotating set of filters, has been blamed for a number of recent crimes in the state.

"This app is a menace to our society," said Governor Nathan Deal. "It's ridiculous that we have to legislate common sense, but I'm glad we're doing something to keep our citizens safe."

The app was initially released in December of 2014 and became popular almost immediately. It has been downloaded more than 100 million times. In addition to the concerns in Georgia, officials in other states have also voiced alarm at the app's potential for misuse.

While some users have praised Photo Roulette for its ability to make them look funny or beautiful, others have used it for more nefarious purposes. There have been reports of sexual assault, bullying and even suicide threats made using the app.

"This is just another example of how technology can be used for harm," said Atlanta City Councilman Howard Shook. "We need to do everything we can to protect our citizens from these kinds of threats."

#  Snapchat Respond to Censorship by Adding Blocking Feature for Georgia

Snapchat has responded to the censorship in Georgia by adding a blocking feature for the country.

As of Monday, users in Georgia will be able to block people and organizations from viewing their stories and snaps. The move came after the social media app was blocked in the country late last week.

The Georgian government says that Snapchat was blocked because it violated local laws by displaying a map of Russia with its breakaway regions highlighted.

Syrian Refugees Stranded at Jordan Border as Blocked Social Media Hurts Aid Efforts

Syrian refugees are stranded at the Jordanian border after WhatsApp and other social media platforms were blocked, hurting aid efforts.

The Jordanian government shut down access to WhatsApp, Facebook, and YouTube on Sunday night amid protests over a new tax. The shutdown has prevented aid groups from communicating with refugees stranded at the border.

The Jordan Society for Electronic Media issued a statement saying that the shutdown was "an attempt to muzzle freedom of expression and mislead public opinion."

#  How to Bypass Snapchat's Geo-Location Blocks

It's no secret that Snapchat has been stepping up its geo-location blocking game as of late. However, for those of us who like to live a little on the edge, there are still ways to get around these blocks. In this article, we will show you three different methods for bypassing Snapchat's geo-location blocks.

The first method is to use a Virtual Private Network (VPN). A VPN is a service that allows you to connect to the internet through a server located in a different country. This can be helpful for bypassing geo-location blocks, as it allows you to appear as if you are physically located in another country. There are many VPN services available, and most of them offer free trials or money-back guarantees so that you can test them out before committing.

The second method is to use a proxy server. Proxy servers work in a similar way to VPNs, but they are typically less reliable and slower. However, they can be useful in certain situations. There are many proxy servers available online, and most of them are free to use.

The third method is to use a web proxy site. A web proxy site is a website that allows you to access websites blocked by your ISP or government. Simply visit the website and enter the address of the website that you want to access. The website will then fetch the page for you and display it in the browser window. Note that some web proxy sites may track your browsing activity, so be sure to read their terms and conditions before using them.

Hopefully, one of these methods will help you bypass Snapchat's geo-location blocks. Just remember to use them at your own risk, as Snapchat may eventually block these methods too.
