#  Norwich City punish Cardiff City for playing without a £10m man

Norwich City produced a superb performance to beat Cardiff City 3-0 at Carrow Road and condemn the Bluebirds to relegation.

The home side were in control from the outset and took the lead in the 31st minute when Teemu Pukki tapped in from close range. The Finn then added a second goal with a superb free-kick in the 56th minute, and Max Aarons completed the rout with a well-taken finish in the 87th minute.

The result means that Cardiff are relegated to the Championship after three seasons in the Premier League, while Norwich move up to 13th place in the table.

Cardiff head coach Neil Warnock was scathing in his assessment of his side's display, telling reporters after the match: "We were pathetic really. We never turned up, it's as simple as that. I take full responsibility - I picked the team and they never turned up."

Norwich manager Daniel Farke was buoyed by his side's victory, saying: "I'm so proud of my players. It was such an important win for us, and I thought we were brilliant from start to finish."
