#  Bluey and Paddy Power celebrate their 10th birthday!

Bluey and Paddy Power are two of the most recognisable faces in British advertising. They first appeared on our screens back in 2008, and quickly became a hit with audiences across the country.

To celebrate their 10th birthday, Paddy Power has created a video retrospective of all the best bits from their time together. The video is a great reminder of some of the funniest moments from their ads, as well as some of the more poignant ones.

Bluey and Paddy Power started life as an unlikely pair. Bluey was an experienced racehorse who had spent years competing at tracks around the country, while Paddy Power was a new, up-and-coming bookmaker.

But from their very first ad together, it was clear that these two were going to be a force to be reckoned with. In the ad, Bluey confidently strides into the bookmakers, lays down a bet, and then proceeds to clean up at the track!

Since then, Bluey and Paddy Power have become famous for their playful banter and light-hearted approach to advertising. In one ad they even manage to take on Donald Trump – something which most brands would never dare try!

The 10th anniversary video is full of memorable moments from their time together. There’s Bluey’s initial scepticism about Paddy Power (“a bookie? Are you sure?”), their wacky costumes and stunts, and of course the many times they’ve managed to make us laugh out loud.

So if you want to relive some of the best bits from Bluey and Paddy Power’s 10 years together, make sure to check out the anniversary video below!

#  How old is Bluey? The Aussie cattle dog turns 10!

On July 7, 2018, the Australian cattle dog Bluey turned 10 years old. This makes her the oldest dog in the world according to the Guinness World Records.

Bluey was born on a farm in Victoria, Australia, and was adopted by Brian McLaren when she was just six weeks old. The pair have been inseparable ever since.

In honor of Bluey’s momentous birthday, Brian created a social media campaign called #TeamBluey, which has since garnered over 11,000 followers on Instagram alone. The account posts photos and videos of Bluey’s everyday life—including her many adventures chasing cows and playing with her canine siblings—to remind everyone that “age is just a number!”

When Guinness World Records caught wind of Bluey’s impressive age, they reached out to Brian to verify the documentation and officially award Bluey with the title of world’s oldest living dog.

Brian says he is “over the moon” about his pup’s record-breaking status and plans to keep celebrating her long life for as long as she remains healthy and happy. Way to go, Bluey!

#  Bluey and Bingo turn 10 – a celebration of long life and love!

This year, two of the world’s oldest dogs turned 10 years old. Bluey, an Australian Cattle Dog from Rochester, Victoria, and Bingo, a Beagle from Otsego, Michigan, both celebrated their birthdays in November.

Both dogs were born in 2008 and have since enjoyed long and happy lives with their respective families. Bluey was even named the world’s oldest dog by the Guinness World Records in 2018, a title that he held until his death earlier this year.

Bluey and Bingo are amazing examples of the joy that can come from adopting an older dog. Both animals have brought untold happiness to their families and have been a vital part of those families for a decade or more.

In honor of these two wonderful dogs’ birthdays, we’d like to celebrate the many benefits of owning an older dog. Here are just a few of them:

1) Older dogs are typically calmer and more relaxed than younger ones. They’re also less likely to get into trouble or chew on your shoes!

2) Older dogs often know their place in the family and are less likely to be aggressive or territorial. This makes them perfect for households with kids or other pets.

3) Older dogs are often already house-trained and know basic commands like sit and stay. This can make life much easier for new owners!

4) Older dogs often have a mellower temperament and aren’t as prone to barking or whining as younger dogs can be. This makes them ideal for people who work long hours or live in apartments.

5) Finally, older dogs often come with a lower price tag than puppies – making them an affordable option for people on a budget.

Overall, there are many reasons to consider adopting an older dog. They can bring years of love and companionship to your home, and they can be just as rewarding to own as any puppy or kitten!

#  Happy 10th birthday, Bluey and Paddy Power!

The European Championship has had a bit of a makeover in the last 10 years. For its inaugural edition in 2004, just 16 teams took part. Held jointly by Portugal and Spain, it was a tournament marked by dour, negative football, exemplified by Greece’s surprise victory over hosts Portugal in the final.

In 2008, UEFA decided to expand the tournament to 24 teams. This led to the addition of new qualifying rounds, plus an increase in the number of friendlies played by teams as they attempted to secure a spot in the competition. The move also led to criticism from some corners that smaller nations were being disadvantaged.

For UEFA, however, expanding the European Championship was all about giving more countries a chance to be a part of Europe’s elite international event. And with 24 teams now taking part, that objective has certainly been achieved.

The first expansion brought about one memorable moment: Northern Ireland’s shock win over Spain in Nice in 2016. Trailing 1-0 with just minutes remaining, Northern Ireland’s captain Gareth McAuley produced one of the great European Championship goals to level things up before Michael McGovern saved a penalty in stoppage time to send his country through to the next round.

Ahead of this year’s tournament in France, Bluey and Paddy Power – two long-standing sponsors of the European Championship – celebrated their 10th birthday. To mark the occasion, we take a look back at some of their most memorable moments over the last decade…

2014: Portugal shock Spain with late winner
Portugal secured one of the biggest shocks in European Championship history when they beat holders Spain in dramatic fashion in Donetsk. With Cristiano Ronaldo firing on all cylinders, Fernando Torres looking short of match practice and Diego Costa struggling for goalscoring form, Paulo Bento’s side pulled off a stunning victory with an 88th minute winner from Silvestre Varela.

2016: Wales make it all the way to semi-finals
While England disappointed yet again on home soil at Euro 2016 (losing 2-1 to Iceland), Wales stunned everyone by reaching the semi-finals stage – becoming only the fourth British nation ever to do so. Led by inspirational captain Ashley Williams and backed up by Bale & co., Chris Coleman’s side narrowly missed out on making history by losing 3-1 to eventual champions Portugal in Lyon.

2018: Paddy Power become title sponsor for France finals
This year, Paddy Power signed on as title sponsor for France’s finals tournament – becoming official betting partners of UEFA for both Euro 2016 and this year’s World Cup. The move coincides with Paddy Power making significant investments into its French business (including becoming exclusive retail partner for French Ligue 1) as it looks to make further gains in what is already Europe’s second largest regulated betting market after Italy.

#  Bluey and Bingo – still going strong at 10 years old!

Bluey and Bingo are two Staffordshire bull terriers that are celebrating an amazing 10 years together this year. The devoted duo have never spent a day apart since being brought together as puppies and are now regarded as one of the longest-lasting dog couples in the world.

Owner Claire Stoneman, from Dorset, UK, says the key to their successful relationship is plenty of exercise, plenty of love and plenty of healthy food. “I’ve never had to separate them for a fight – they just love being around each other,” she says.

The lucky pair also enjoy regular holidays together, with a recent trip to North Wales capturing some happy memories on camera. “They absolutely loved it – running up and down the cliffs and playing on the beach,” recalls Claire. “It was great to see them having so much fun together.”

Bluey and Bingo are undoubtedly a very special pair – but they’re not the only dogs out there that have proven just how strong love can be! Here are five more heartwarming tales of canine couples that have melted our hearts…

1. Gizmo and Jake

Gizmo and Jake were two rescue dogs that became inseparable after being adopted by the same family in Sacramento, California. The adorable pair quickly developed a close bond, spending hours playing together in the backyard and going for walks around their neighborhood. When Gizmo sadly passed away in 2012 aged just six, Jake mourned his loss for months – refusing to eat or drink until he eventually passed away from a broken heart three months later. Their story touched the nation and captured the hearts of people all over the world, proving once again that dogs really do know how to love unconditionally.

2. Patches and Snuggles

Patches and Snuggles are two guinea pigs who became best friends at an animal shelter in San Diego, California. When staff at the shelter noticed how close they had become, they decided to put them in the same cage – and the rest was history! The inseparable pair quickly became known as ‘the most romantic couple in town’ due to their constant snuggling and cuddling while they slept. Sadly, Snuggles died in 2017 after a long battle with cancer – but Patches still visits his grave every day to remember his furry loved one.

3. Poldi and Ludi

Poldi and Ludi are two elderly greyhounds who were paired up at a rescue center near Munich, Germany, due to their shared love of napping! The two greyhounds quickly hit it off and started following each other around everywhere they went, even taking turns sleeping next to each other in their kennel. When Poldi sadly passed away last year aged 14, Ludi was so bereft that he stopped eating or drinking until he too passed away a few weeks later. Their touching story serves as a reminder thattrue friendship can transcend species barriers!

 4. Bella and Barney


Bella and Barney were two Labradors who were adopted by the same family as puppies and grew up together in Toronto, Canada. The close friends would often be found playing fetch in the park or swimming in their owner’s pool – but their favorite pastime was always just cuddling on the couch together watching TV. In 2016, Bella sadly passed away from cancer at just nine years old leaving Barney heartbroken. But despite his immense grief, Barney continued living with his family until his own death earlier this year at age 14 – cementing his place as one of the longest-lasting dog couples in history .
