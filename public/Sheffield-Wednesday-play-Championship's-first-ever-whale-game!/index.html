The matchup against Wolverhampton Wanderers is sure to be a wet and wild affair, as both teams battle for the right to progress to the next round of the playoffs.</p>
<p>Sheffield Wednesday manager Jos Luhukay is looking forward to the challenge. “Playing against Wolves will be a difficult task, but we are ready for it,” he said in a press conference. “We have a strong team and I believe we can win this game.”</p>
<p>Wolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo is also confident of his team’s chances. “We are coming into this matchup at full strength,” he said. “I expect it to be a very close game, but I believe we can win.”</p>
<p>The whale game is sure to be a memorable one for fans of both clubs. It will also be an important one, as the winner will move on to the next round of the playoffs. Whoever emerges victorious will have bragging rights for years to come!</p>

The Rams sit in 22nd place in the table, two points adrift of safety, while the Millers are five points clear of the relegation zone in 17th place.</p>
<p>Rotherham United will be without striker Danny Ward who is on loan from Liverpool, due to the terms of the deal. Ward has scored six goals in 16 appearances for the Millers this season.</p>
<p>Derby County will be looking to midfielder Bradley Johnson for inspiration. Johnson has scored four goals in his last five appearances for Derby County.</p>
<p>Rotherham United’s £10m man, Kieffer Moore, could cause problems for Derby County. Moore has scored six goals in his last seven appearances for Rotherham United.</p>
<h1 id="Birmingham-City-v-Queens-Park-Rangers-live-on-TV-Who-is-chasing-the-money"><a href="#Birmingham-City-v-Queens-Park-Rangers-live-on-TV-Who-is-chasing-the-money" class="headerlink" title="Birmingham City v Queens Park Rangers live on TV: Who is chasing the money?"></a>Birmingham City v Queens Park Rangers live on TV: Who is chasing the money?</h1><p>The much anticipated live match between Birmingham City and Queens Park Rangers will be aired on TV this week. It is a match up of two teams that are currently chasing the money, with each sitting in the middle of the pack in the Championship table.</p>
<p>For Birmingham City, this game is an important one as they look to improve their position and make a push for promotion. They come into this game following a disappointing 1-1 draw against Burton Albion, which saw them miss the chance to move into the top six.</p>
<p>Queens Park Rangers, meanwhile, are looking to distance themselves from the relegation zone. They come into this game on the back of a 3-1 victory over Sheffield Wednesday, which saw them move out of the relegation places for the first time in months.</p>
<p>Team News</p>
<p>Birmingham City will be without David Davis and Cheikh Ndoye due to injury, while Michael Morrison is suspended. Clayton Donaldson and Jacques Maghoma are both doubts for the game.</p>
<p>Queens Park Rangers will be without Matt Smith due to injury, while Luke Freeman and Massimo Luongo are both doubtful for the game.</p>
<p>Predicted Lineups</p>
<p>Birmingham City: Stockdale; Colin, Roberts, Dean, Grounds; Gardner, Kieftenbeld; Boga, Jota, Gallagher; Vassell</p>
<p>Queens Park Rangers: Lumley; Furlong, Onuoha, Halliday, Bidwell; Scowen, Freeman; Wszolek, Eze, Andre Green; Sylla</p>

<p>Wolves come into the game off the back of a 3-2 victory against Southampton, while Brighton were unfortunate to only draw 1-1 with Liverpool.</p>
<p>Nuno Espirito Santo’s side are currently third in the table, just one point behind leaders Manchester City and Liverpool, while Chris Hughton’s Brighton are in 10th place.</p>
<p>The two sides have met just once before in the Premier League, with Wolves recording a 2-0 victory at Molineux Stadium.</p>
<p>Both clubs have made strong starts to life in the top flight and will be determined to pick up all three points on Saturday.</p>
<p>Here is a preview of the game:</p>
<p>Team News</p>
<p>Wolverhampton Wanderers are likely to be without Matt Doherty due to injury, while Ruben Vinagre is also doubtful. Ivan Cavaleiro could start after returning from suspension last weekend.</p>
<p>Brighton &amp; Hove Albion are without Dale Stephens due to suspension, but otherwise have a full squad available. Anthony Knockaert could return to the starting lineup after coming on as a substitute against Liverpool last weekend.</p>
<h1 id="Norwich-City-punish-Cardiff-City-for-playing-without-a-£10m-man"><a href="#Norwich-City-punish-Cardiff-City-for-playing-without-a-£10m-man" class="headerlink" title="Norwich City punish Cardiff City for playing without a £10m man"></a>Norwich City punish Cardiff City for playing without a £10m man</h1><p>Norwich City produced a superb performance to beat Cardiff City 3-0 at Carrow Road and condemn the Bluebirds to relegation.</p>
<p>The home side were in control from the outset and took the lead in the 31st minute when Teemu Pukki tapped in from close range. The Finn then added a second goal with a superb free-kick in the 56th minute, and Max Aarons completed the rout with a well-taken finish in the 87th minute.</p>
<p>The result means that Cardiff are relegated to the Championship after three seasons in the Premier League, while Norwich move up to 13th place in the table.</p>
<p>Cardiff head coach Neil Warnock was scathing in his assessment of his side’s display, telling reporters after the match: “We were pathetic really. We never turned up, it’s as simple as that. I take full responsibility - I picked the team and they never turned up.”</p>
<p>Norwich manager Daniel Farke was buoyed by his side’s victory, saying: “I’m so proud of my players. It was such an important win for us, and I thought we were brilliant from start to finish.”</p>
<p>The result means that Cardiff are relegated to the Championship after three seasons in the Premier League, while Norwich move up to 13th place in the table.</p>
